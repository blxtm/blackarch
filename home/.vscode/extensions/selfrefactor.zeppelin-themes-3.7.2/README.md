# Zeppelin(as in Led Zeppelin) themes

All themes use three colors schema and have the same light yellow background.

This theme is spin-off from [Niketa themes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=selfrefactor.Niketa-theme) as it grew beyond reasonable size for a single bundle of themes.

> The repo contains also internal theme generator used for creation of the themes

Git diff colors are blue and ochra similar to the ones suggested in the article [Your syntax highlighter is wrong](https://jameshfisher.com/2014/05/11/your-syntax-highlighter-is-wrong/)
